Simple HTML Gallery
===================

Create an single-page HTML gallery with:

    $ ./create_gallery vacation-photos index.html

where `vacation-photos` is the name of the directory where all images from the current directory and an `index.html` file will be placed. The created directory can then be moved into your document root (e.g. `/var/www/html/`)
